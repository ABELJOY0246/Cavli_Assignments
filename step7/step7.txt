Assignment 7: Error Simulation & Debugging

Note:
The CelerSMS AT Emulator has very limited support for error simulation and does NOT support the AT+CMEE command or detailed error messages. Therefore, most of this assignment will be theoretical or based on what would happen on real hardware like Cavli C10GS or C42QM.

--------------------------------------------------------
Objective:
To understand how to simulate and interpret AT command errors. In real modules, AT+CMEE enables detailed error responses which help during debugging. In CelerSMS, you can try unsupported or incorrect commands to see simple “ERROR” responses.

It's not working in celersms.So here it will be theoretical explanation of how to do it.

1. AT+CMEE — (NOT SUPPORTED in CelerSMS)

Expected Syntax:
       AT+CMEE=<mode>

- 0 = Disable (returns just “ERROR”)
- 1 = Enable numeric errors (e.g., CME ERROR: 10)
- 2 = Enable verbose errors (e.g., SIM not inserted)

But in CelerSMS:
Typing `AT+CMEE=2` returns:
ERROR
So, error codes and descriptions cannot be viewed in this emulator.

2. Testing Basic Errors in CelerSMS

Try these in the emulator:

a) Typing invalid command
Example:
AT+XYZ
Response:
→ ERROR
(This shows the emulator doesn’t recognize the command)

b) Incomplete/incorrect command syntax
Example:
AT+CMGF
Response:
→ ERROR
(Should be AT+CMGF=1 or AT+CMGF=0)

c) Unsupported valid command
Example:
AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","internet"
Response:
→ ERROR
(This shows the emulator does not support PDP context)

d) SMS Read error (if no message exists)
Example:
AT+CMGR=1
Response:
→ ERROR or empty response (depends on simulator state)


3. What Happens on a Real Modem

If using a real Cavli module:
You can enable detailed errors using:
AT+CMEE=2

Then when an error occurs, you get:
+CME ERROR: <code> → which helps identify the issue

Example:
AT+CMGS (without setting CMGF)
Response:
+CME ERROR: 303  → Operation not allowed


4. Error Code Reference (Theoretical)

Common +CME ERROR codes:
10 → SIM not inserted  
13 → SIM failure  
21 → Invalid index  
30 → No network service  
50 → Incorrect parameters  
100 → Unknown error  
515 → Unrecognized access string  

These codes only appear if CMEE=1 or CMEE=2 is supported, which is not the case in CelerSMS.
