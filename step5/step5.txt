 5: PDP Context & Internet Setup
 ● Not supported in CelerSMS AT Emulator (skip or mark theoretical)
 ➢ Assignment: Research APN configuration with AT+CGDCONT on real modem


1. AT+CGDCONT – Define PDP Context
This is the main command to define how the module will connect to the internet.
Syntax:
    AT+CGDCONT=<cid>,"<PDP_type>","<APN>"
Where:
  <cid> is the context ID (usually 1)
  <PDP_type> is usually "IP" or "IPV4V6"
  <APN> is the Access Point Name provided by your mobile operator
Example:
  AT+CGDCONT=1,"IP","jionet"
This command sets up PDP context 1 to use IP protocol and connects through the APN "jionet".
To check what has been set:
    AT+CGDCONT?
Expected response:
    +CGDCONT: 1,"IP","jionet",,0,0
    OK

It is showing ERROR in CelerSMS, because PDP configuration is not supported in the emulator.

2. AT+CGATT – Attach or Detach from GPRS
This command is used to attach or detach the module from the GPRS (internet) service.
To attach:
  AT+CGATT=1
To detach:
  AT+CGATT=0
To check status:
  AT+CGATT?
Expected response:
  +CGATT: 1 → means the module is attached to data service
  +CGATT: 0 → not attached
In CelerSMS, this usually returns +CGATT: 0 or ERROR because it cannot simulate network attachment.

3. AT+CGACT – Activate PDP Context
This command is used to turn on the actual data session.
To activate PDP context 1:
  AT+CGACT=1,1
To deactivate it:
  AT+CGACT=0,1
To check current state:
  AT+CGACT?
Expected response:
  +CGACT: 1,1 → context is active
  +CGACT: 1,0 → context is not active

Explanation of Terms in These Commands:

PDP Type – This tells the modem what type of data protocol to use.
Common values:
"IP" → IPv4
"IPV6" → IPv6
"IPV4V6" → dual stack (both IPv4 and IPv6)

APN (Access Point Name) – This is the gateway between the mobile network and the internet. Every SIM card provider has its own APN.
Example values:

Airtel: airtelgprs.com
Jio: jionet
BSNL: bsnlnet

CID (Context ID) – A number that identifies each PDP context. Most setups use 1. You can have multiple PDP contexts in advanced use cases.
Attach/Detach – "Attach" means the module registers itself to the data network. "Detach" means it disconnects. Without attaching, the module cannot activate PDP.
Activate/Deactivate – Activation of the context allows the modem to start sending/receiving data using the defined APN and IP type.
Behavior in CelerSMS Emulator:
CelerSMS is only a simulation environment. It does not simulate:

SIM card interaction with a real network, Actual internet data transmission, Real IP address assignment

As a result:
AT+CGDCONT may give ERROR
AT+CGATT will always return 0 or ERROR
AT+CGACT will not activate the context
This is normal behavior for CelerSMS and does not indicate a mistake in command usage. The emulator is best used for understanding command syntax.
