 8: Custom AT Commands
 ● CelerSMS supports limited standard GSM commands only
 ➢ Assignment: Research any suitable Cavli product and Propose 3 custom AT commands and 
mock expected responses manually

Custom AT commands are special, manufacturer-defined instructions.
They are used to:
Control extra hardware features.
Trigger firmware updates.
Combine multiple actions into one command.
Access module-specific functions.



Module Used: Cavli C1-RM (NB-IoT/EGPRS)

1. AT+NVSETRRCRLSTIMER10
Purpose: Set the RRC release timer for low power mode optimization. Helps manage how quickly the device returns to idle after data transmission.
Syntax: AT+NVSETRRCRLSTIMER10=<value>
Example:
  AT+NVSETRRCRLSTIMER10=1
Expected Response:
  OK
Details:
- <value> can be from 0 to 15 (representing different timeout durations).
- Useful for reducing power consumption in NB-IoT mode.



2. AT+CGAPNRC
Purpose:Configure the APN with extended parameters specific to Cavli's NB-IoT implementation.
Syntax:AT+CGAPNRC=<cid>,"<APN>","<username>","<password>"
Example:
  AT+CGAPNRC=1,"internet.cavli","user","pass"
Expected Response:
  OK
Details:
- Enhances the basic AT+CGDCONT command by including authentication fields.
- Ensures reliable APN provisioning for remote deployment.


3. AT+NIPDATA
Purpose:Send raw data in Non-IP mode (used in NB-IoT for reduced overhead).
Syntax:AT+NIPDATA=<length>,<data>
Example:
  AT+NIPDATA=4,"A1B2"
Expected Response:
  OK
Details:
- Bypasses TCP/IP layer for minimal packet size.
- Useful in low-power, low-bandwidth applications (e.g., metering, telemetry).
