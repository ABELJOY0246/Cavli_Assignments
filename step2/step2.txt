 2: Syntax & Status Commands
 ● Supported: AT+CSQ, AT+CPIN?, AT+COPS?
 ● Test signal quality, SIM status, and network operator info
 ➢ Assignment: Extract numeric response (e.g., RSSI) manually or via script

1. AT+CSQ
Command: AT+CSQ
Purpose: Check signal strength (RSSI) and bit error rate (BER)
Expected Response:
  +CSQ: <rssi>,<ber>
  OK
Actual Response:
  +CSQ: 21,0
  OK
Interpretation:
RSSI = 21 → Good signal (~ -61 dBm to -69 dBm).The RSSI value returned by the AT+CSQ command is given in a numeric index from 0 to 31, not directly in dBm. We have to convert it into dBm. Lower dBm (more negative) = weaker signal, Higher RSSI value = stronger signal.
BER = 0 → No bit errors, connection quality is strong

2. AT+CPIN?
Command: AT+CPIN?
Purpose: Check SIM card status
Expected Response:
   +CPIN: READY
   OK
Actual Response:
   +CPIN: "READY"
   OK
Interpretation:
SIM is inserted and ready

3. AT+COPS?
Command: AT+COPS?
Purpose: Check the current network operator selection
Expected Response (Real Hardware):
    +COPS: 0,0,"NetworkName",<access_technology>
    OK
Actual Response (Emulator):
    ERROR
Reason for ERROR:
The emulator doesn’t simulate real-time operator selection or network registration. AT+COPS? requires actual cellular network data, which the emulator cannot generate without hardware or network simulation. Some emulators leave it unsupported or trigger ERROR by default.

Expected Response Format:
+COPS: <mode>,<format>,<operator>,<access_tech>
OK

Explanation of Each Field:

1. <mode> – Operator Selection Mode
Value | Description
------|--------------------------
0     | Automatic mode
1     | Manual mode
2     | Deregister from network
3     | Set only format (no selection)
4     | Manual then automatic

2. <format> – Operator Name Format
Value | Description
------|--------------------------------
0     | Long alphanumeric format (e.g., "Jio")
1     | Short alphanumeric format
2     | Numeric format (e.g., "40410")

3. <operator> – Operator Identifier
Depends on the format:
- If format = 0 → Operator name (e.g., "Jio")
- If format = 2 → Numeric code (e.g., 40410 = MCC 404 (India), MNC 10)

4. <access_tech> – Radio Technology
Value | Technology
------|--------------------------
0     | GSM
1     | Compact GSM
2     | UTRAN (3G)
3     | GSM w/EGPRS (EDGE)
4     | UTRAN w/HSDPA
5     | UTRAN w/HSUPA
6     | UTRAN w/HSDPA and HSUPA
7     | LTE (4G)
9     | Cat-M (LTE-M)
10    | NB-IoT

Example Response:
+COPS: 0,0,"Jio",7
OK

This means:
- Mode 0: Automatic network selection
- Format 0: Operator name (long format)
- Operator: "Jio"
- Access Technology: LTE (value 7)

Extra information about AT+CPIN? :

Command:
AT+CPIN?

Typical Response:
+CPIN: <status>
OK

Possible <status> Variants and Their Meaning:

1. READY
   - SIM is inserted and fully functional.

2. SIM PIN
   - SIM requires a 4-digit PIN to unlock.
   - Unlock using: AT+CPIN="1234"

3. SIM PUK
   - SIM is locked due to too many wrong PIN attempts.
   - Requires 8-digit PUK and new PIN.
   - Unlock using: AT+CPIN="PUK","newpin"

4. PH-SIM PIN
   - Phone-level SIM lock is active.
   - Requires device PIN to access SIM.

5. PH-FSIM PIN
   - Facility-specific SIM PIN (rare).

6. PH-FSIM PUK
   - Facility-specific SIM PUK (rare).

7. SIM NOT INSERTED
   - SIM is not detected or inserted improperly.

8. SIM PIN2
   - Second-level PIN required (e.g., for fixed dialing features).

9. SIM PUK2
   - PUK2 needed if SIM PIN2 is blocked.

10. NOT READY
    - SIM initialization is incomplete or pending.

11. ERROR
    - Invalid response, no modem/SIM access, or command not supported.
