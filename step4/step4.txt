 4: SMS Mode Simulation
 ● Supported: AT+CMGF=1, AT+CMGS, AT+CMGR
 ● Send and receive SMS from emulator UI
 ➢ Assignment: Send test message, receive response, and record log

This task simulates SMS functionality using CelerSMS AT Emulator. It focuses on configuring SMS format, sending SMS, and understanding message index referencing.

1. AT+CMGF – Set SMS Message Format
Used to choose SMS format:
  0 = PDU mode (hexadecimal format)
  1 = Text mode (readable format)
Test command:
  AT+CMGF=?
Response:
  +CMGF: (0,1) OK
Read command:
  AT+CMGF?
Response:
  +CMGF: 1 OK
Write command:
  AT+CMGF=1 → sets to text mode
  AT+CMGF=0 → sets to PDU mode
Response:
  OK

Note: Text mode must be set before using AT+CMGS or AT+CMGR.

2. AT+CMGS – Send SMS Message
Used to send SMS to a number.
Syntax:
AT+CMGS="phone_number"
Then type the message, press Ctrl+Z to send.
Example:
  AT+CMGS="+919876543210"
  Hello<Ctrl+Z
Response (in CelerSMS):
  +CMGS: 1
   OK

3. AT+CMGR – Read SMS Message
Used to read a stored message from memory using its index.
Syntax:
  AT+CMGR=index
Example:
  AT+CMGR=1
Actual Response (in CelerSMS):
  ERROR
Expected Response (on real hardware):
    +CMGR: "REC READ","+919876543210","","24/07/25,12:34:56+22"
    Hello
    OK

This command is not supported in CelerSMS since it does not simulate SMS storage.

4. Understanding SMS Index
Each SMS (sent or received) is stored at a memory location identified by an index number, starting from 1.
AT+CMGS returns the index where the message was stored.
AT+CMGR reads the message at a specific index.
AT+CMGD deletes a message by index.
AT+CMGL="ALL" lists all messages with their indexes.
